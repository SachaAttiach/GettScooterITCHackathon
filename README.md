# GettScooter
ITC hackathon project

Hello, welcome to my hackathon project! 

The theme of the hackathon was transportation. 

Myself and my team were aware that a representative from bird (e-scooter company) would be present and part of the
judging panel and so we came up with this project! 

The aim was to be able to predict availability of a scooter at a specific date/time and location to plan a trip ahead and so together with a fullstack and data science team we accomplished just that!

Here is a short demo of this project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzoSONpToZA&ab_channel=Sacha

Hope you enjoy!
